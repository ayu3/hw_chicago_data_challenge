COMP 312 OPEN SOURCE COMPUTING

I am using the "Public Health Statistics - Life Expectancy by Community Area" (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Public-Health-Statistics-Life-Expectancy-By-Commun/qjr3-bm53)
and "Grocery Stores-2011" (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Grocery-Stores-2011/4u6w-irs9) 
datasets to see if there is a correlation between the ease of access to healthy foods and longer life expectancy. 
Specifically looking at whether residents who live in communities where there is a larger amount of grocery stores tend to live 
longer.
